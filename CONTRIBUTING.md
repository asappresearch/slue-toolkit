### Filing an issue (Bug or Enhancement)

Please create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/asappresearch/slue-toolkit/issues).

Please follow the templates shown when you click on “New Issue.”

### Fixing a bug (PR, etc.)

Open an issue for the bug if one doesn’t exist already. Then start working on your own branch off of dev with the following naming convention: issue-###_short-desc_github-handle, using the issue number for the relevant bug. Once you have finished your work on your own branch (and ideally added new tests to catch the bug!), you can open a PR. The PR will be reviewed and merged, and ultimately included in a future release (see next section).
